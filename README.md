Book Library Manager

Overview

This project implements a simple Books Library Management System using a Microsoft SQL Server Database. Designed as an educational tool for understanding database operations and object-oriented programming in Python, it features a basic Data Access Layer (DAL), unit tests, and a client application.

The system manages books, customers, and loans, with functionalities to add, remove, and search for books and customers, manage loans, and track late returns.

Features
* Microsoft SQL Server Database: Utilizes a simple database schema with three tables: Books, Customers, and Loans.
* Data Management using Python and ORM: Supports adding and removing books and customers, loaning books, and returning them.
* Search and Display: Enables finding books and customers by name, displaying all records, and listing late loans.

This project was developed as part of Python Full Stack Development course, at John Bryce College.
